This repository contains a TDD coding exercise taken from [treepie](https://github.com/avh4/treepie), a real side-project of mine.

This is an example that I use to demonstrate how to let tests and refactoring **drive** the implementation of an algorithm.  I did a live coding demo of this for a lightning talk at Pivotal Labs.

To do the exercise yourself, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avh4/tdd-demo-outline-parser.git
cd tdd-demo-outline-parser
npm install
npm run-script watch
```

Then open `spec/OutlineParserSpec.js` and uncomment tests one-by-one.

For different solutions, see the [tags in this repository](https://github.com/avh4/tdd-demo-outline-parser/tags).
